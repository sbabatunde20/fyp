Footnote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) In 2013 legislation was introduced to allow councils to increase the Council Tax payable on certain types of long-term empty property. As a result, from 2013 onwards, many councils have carried out reviews of properties classed as vacant or second homes, with some being re-classified as occupied. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The legislation also changed the definitions of such properties. In addition, there have been some issues with how properties affected by the new charges are recorded. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore any changes over time in the numbers and percentages of occupied dwellings, vacant dwellings and second homes should be treated with caution as they may be a result of the issues associated with the 2013 legislation rather than real differences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
